## Pair sum
### Problem Statement :
Given a random integer array A and a number x. Find and print the pair of elements in the array which sum to x.
Array A can contain duplicate elements.
While printing a pair, print the smaller element first.
That is, if a valid pair is (6, 5) print "5 6". There is no constraint that out of 5 pairs which have to be printed in 1st line. You can print pairs in any order, just be careful about the order of elements in a pair.
### Input :
Line 1 : Integer N (Array size) <br>
Line 2 : Array elements (separated by space) <br>
Line 3 : Integer x
### Output :
Line 1 : Pair 1 elements (separated by space) <br>
Line 2 : Pair 2 elements (separated by space) <br>
Line 3 : and so on
### Constraints
1 <= N <= 1000 <br>
1 <= x <= 100
### Sample Input :
9 <br>
1 3 6 2 5 4 3 2 4 <br>
7
### Sample Output :
1 6 <br>
3 4 <br>
3 4 <br>
2 5 <br>
2 5 <br>
3 4 <br>
3 4 <br>
